Directories:
==========
py/ contains python scripts
preds/ contains predictions file
data/ contains raw data, data splits, and prediction scans

Python scripts:
==============
Script to write out predictions, for example, from split0
python py/kfold_write_preds.py split0

Script to plot the predicitons (in this case, of all 5 splits)
python py/kfoldCI_plot_testCV.py 

Script to write out all predictions to preds/predictionsCI.csv
python py/scan-CI.py

raw data for the mutations in dataset
data/scores.csv

prediction scans and also raw data
data/scans/*

All predictions to BK channel (PDB numbering)
