This is the README file for the BK channel voltage-gating predictor repository.


Directories:
==========
py/ contains python scripts
preds/ contains predictions file
data/ contains raw data, data splits, and prediction scans

Data files:
===========
scores.csv: contains the raw energy terms and descriptors for all mutations in expt data set
BK_mutations.xlsx: all the expt data (from literature and unpublished from Cui lab), including unused in publication
  (some mutations don't match human sequence, some don't contain dV1/2 at nominally 0 microMolar Ca2+, etc)


scans/ : contains the data for all mutations, not just those in expt dataset
  X.csv : input features for all residues to X (single-letter AA code)
  X.npy : predicted dV1/2 for all residue to X (single-letter AA code)

splitN/ : contains the 5 80/20 splits presented in publication
  each of these directories itself contains 5-fold CV on the 80% training data for that split, so there are corresponding files:
  XN_train.npy / yN_train.npy
  XN_test.npy / yN_test.npy
  [X/y]5_train.npy contains the full 80% training data for splitN
  p[X/y]N_[train/test].npy : predictions 
  
  validation/ : contains the remaining 20%


Prediction files:
================

predictionsCI.csv: data file contains predicted dV1/2 +/- error estimate for all mutations, and some additonal information to guide a search in columns:
  NmutNeighbors: Number of mutations (in our expt dataset) within an 8A cutoff of the residue
  Resid, WT and MT (single-letter AA abbreviation)

CM_mut.csv: list of all residues and the number of mutations within 8A in the expt dataset

Python scripts:
==============
Script to write out predictions, for example, from split0
python py/kfold_write_preds.py split0

Script to plot the predicitons (in this case, of all 5 splits)
python py/kfoldCI_plot_testCV.py 

Script to write out all predictions to preds/predictionsCI.csv
python py/scan-CI.py

raw data for the mutations in dataset
data/scores.csv

prediction scans and also raw data
data/scans/*

All predictions to BK channel (PDB numbering)
preds/predictionsCI.csv
